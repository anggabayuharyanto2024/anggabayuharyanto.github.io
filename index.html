            <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1svAXKlKPxpRT3oPQj7BDrhWkpZUis43W=s220" alt="Angga Bayu Haryanto">
            <p>I am an indie game developer and programmer with a strong passion for learning new things and achieving great feats to enhance my experiences.</p>
            <p>Working at Telkom Indonesia has greatly encouraged me to collaborate with many talented individuals who have great minds and innovative concepts. Over the years, I have honed my skills in Excel, Database Management, Python, Web Development, and Game Development as a way to further my self-development.</p>
            <p>I believe we are living in an era of convenience, where almost everything can be managed with just a tap—a true digital era. My goal in life is to create lasting legacies that can be beneficial to many and used by others.</p>
            <p>Beyond my professional work, I enjoy reading and gaming in my spare time. Occasionally, I travel to relaxing and calming places for peace of mind. These activities enrich my creativity and provide new insights for many fresh ideas.</p>
            <p>I am always ready to collaborate and share ideas on various projects. Feel free to connect with me on social media below—hopefully, we can become good friends!</p>
